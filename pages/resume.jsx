          As a full-stack developer, I transitioned from tax and developed a
          cross-platform mobile application for Harpia Sports, making their
          hockey training program more accessible. In a team setting, I built a
          MERN stack web application providing outdoor activity suggestions
          based on weather conditions. I also developed a REST API that
          functions as a command-line interface game using Express.
        </p>
        <p>
          I excel in web development, mobile application development, and the
          MERN stack. My expertise in troubleshooting and testing software has
          enabled me to debug and improve code efficiency, achieving a
          remarkable 40% decrease in system errors and a 20% increase in
          software performance. Additionally, I integrated third-party APIs from
          external applications into web platforms.
        </p>

          While on my career break, I pursued several online courses to enhance
          my skills in web development and programming languages. I have
          completed courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and was able
          to apply these skills to develop functional projects. Additionally, I
          completed a project management professional development program and
          opportunely implemented my learnings in managing successful projects.
        </p>

          Before my transition, I worked as a Tax Coordinator at Plains
          Midstream Canada. There, I utilized data analytics to process and
          monitor tax-related transactions, resulting in a 20% increase in
          transaction accuracy. I conducted in-depth analysis and interpretation
          of tax regulations, leading to a 15% reduction in tax-related errors
          and penalties. Furthermore, I streamlined and improved tax processes
          and procedures, resulting in a 30% increase in efficiency and saving
          10 hours per week in manual labor. I maintained open communication by
          presenting regular updates on audit status to tax auditors, resulting
          in a 25% decrease in audit duration. Finally, I prepared written
          responses or tax return amendments to resolve state and federal
          notices, resulting in a 90% success rate in resolving tax issues
          within the first attempt.
